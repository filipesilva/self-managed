  <h4>What is Dayplanner?</h4>
  <p>
    There are always many things one can focus on during the day.
    But some things have a disproportionate impact on your life.
    Identifying and focusing on the disproportionately important can be hard when there are many
    things vying for your attention, but it's much easier to do with planning ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dayplanner is a tool to help you deliberately consider how to use your day, and review your
    plan as the day goes on.
    You can also review past days and set reminders for future days so nothing is missed.
    Setting a reminder to do something later is often enough to stop thinking about it.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's not important to be very detailed.
    The purpose of using Dayplanner isn't to create an exact record of your day.
    Rather, it's purpose is to help you think about how you want your day to be like before you get
    into the thick of it.
  </p>

  <h4>How should I use it?</h4>
  <p>
    Sometime at the start of your day, open dayplanner and think about the most important things
    you want to do today.
    Try to keep it short, maybe 2 or 3 things.
    Pick an hour for each of those.
  </p>
  <p>
    Write it down on dayplanner with the hour, followed by the thing, and then press enter.
    For instance, "10 - Make a planning document for project X" or "18:30 Go to the gym".
  </p>
  <p>
    It will be added to the dayplan at the time you chose.
    If you don't add a time, it will be added at the top as an unsheduled item.
    After you add the first item, press enter or the + button at the bottom to add another one.
  </p>
  <p>
    After adding the most important things, feel free to add as many lesser important things as you
    want.
    Remember to leave enough time around the most important ones though.
  </p>
  <p>
    The current item will highlighted in bold while past items will be faded.
    You can also change the day at the bottom with the date picker, and edit an existing item by
    clicking on it.
  </p>
